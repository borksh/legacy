# Security policy

**Legacy types are deprecated and no longer supported.** They are archived here once they have been removed from [Bork core](https://github.com/borksh/bork) so that they may still be used where workflows require them.

They should not be used for new configuration scripts. Legacy types will not receive security updates as part of core Bork development work, though the community is more than welcome to submit security fixes (or any other types of patch) to this repository.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please raise all security vulnerabilities as an issue. Please provide thorough instructions to demonstrate how to reproduce the flaw. If you are able, you are welcome and encouraged to submit a pull request to fix the vulnerability.

## Securing your installation

The most up-to-date version of the legacy type collection will always be available from this repository. Bork does not feature any built-in update mechanisms, including for legacy types; please ensure that your git client or package manager, if you use one, is keeping Bork up-to-date using this repository's code as its base. Security advisories will be published on this repository page if and when they are discovered, but it is unlikely that types in this repository will be regularly checked.
